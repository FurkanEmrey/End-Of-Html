    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Hello, My name is Furkan.I’m a Computer Engineering student at
      Kahramanmaraş Sütçü Imam University. Technology has always fascinated me,
      pushing me to constantly learn new things and expand my skill set. Right
      now, I’m focusing on mastering Flutter-a decision that’s already reshaped
      how I think about software development and cross-platform apps
    </p>

    <h2>Structed Learning & Hand-On Practice</h2>
    <p>
      My learning philosophy is intensely practical and methodical. Beyond the
      standard academic curriculum, I actively pursue comprehensive online
      courses on platforms like Udemy and Coursera to gain deeper knowledge and
      diverse perspectives. I strategically seek out resources—especially
      textbooks with solved problems—that offer a clear, structured progression
      from foundational concepts to advanced topics. This intentional approach
      ensures I truly grasp the "why and how" behind concepts, rather than
      simply memorizing facts.
    </p>

    <h3>From Code Challenges to Engineering Fundamentals</h3>

    <p>
      I am committed to immediately translating theoretical knowledge into
      tangible outcomes. I consistently practice problem-solving on platforms
      such as HackerRank, CoddyTech, and LeetCode, and I meticulously document
      and share my personal development projects via GitHub and my own website.
    </p>
    Beyond software development, I actively seek out fundamental engineering
    experience. I participate in logic circuit design labs and regularly
    research key topics including digital circuits, electrical fundamentals, and
    data structures.
    <p>
      My inherent curiosity and strong drive for growth encourage me to explore
      the latest technologies, collaborate with peers, and consistently push
      myself beyond the confines of the classroom. Every project, every lesson,
      and every discovery is a deliberate step in building a solid foundation
      for my future as a results-driven computer engineer.
